The evidence supporting the prosecution's case against the perpetrator is multifaceted. The presence of footprints, particularly those of a wooden stump, and a distinct boot with a broad metal heel on the window sill point to the involvement of a wooden-legged man, later identified as Jonathan Small. The muddy marks and the well-defined discs serve as crucial physical evidence. Additionally, the treasure map drawn by Small, discovered in Captain Morstan's possession, provides a concrete link between the convicts and the buried treasure. The narrative unfolds a sequence of events, indicating a motive tied to the unfulfilled conditions surrounding the treasure's acquisition and the subsequent escape or release of the wronged convicts. Major Sholto's fearful reaction upon receiving a letter from India further strengthens the case, as it suggests a realization of the imminent threat posed by the escaped or freed convicts seeking retribution. The evidence, when pieced together, forms a compelling narrative that supports the prosecution's case and helps solve the crime by unraveling the motives, methods, and connections of the perpetrator, Jonathan Small, and his associates.
