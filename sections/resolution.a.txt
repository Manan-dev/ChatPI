The key pieces of evidence that suggest the perpetrator committed the crime are centered around the mysterious treasure and the involvement of Jonathan Small and his associates. The detective, Sherlock Holmes, deduces that the officers obtained the treasure with the help of a map drawn by Jonathan Small, who signed it with the symbol of "the sign of the four." Holmes theorizes that Small and his associates were convicts who could not retrieve the treasure due to their legal constraints. The involvement of Major Sholto, who guards the treasure for years, becomes significant when he receives a letter from India indicating that the wronged men (likely the convicts) had been set free or escaped. The detective concludes that the wooden-legged man encountered by Major Sholto is none other than Jonathan Small. The theory suggests that Small and his associates sought revenge for the unfulfilled condition under which the treasure was brought to England, leading to the events unfolding in the narrative.
