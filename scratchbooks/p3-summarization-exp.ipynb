      "Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long, white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back his left shirt-cuff. For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction. Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but custom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day to day I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest. Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty. His great powers, his masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing him. Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had taken with my lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out no longer. \"Which is it to-day?\" I asked,-\"morphine or cocaine?\" He raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he had opened. \"It is cocaine,\" he said,-\"a seven-per-cent. solution. Would you care to try it?\" \"No, indeed,\" I answered, brusquely. \"My constitution has not got over the Afghan campaign yet. I\n",

He then thrusts the needle back into the chair and sighs of satisfaction. For the past few months, Watson has watched Holmes perform this routine three times a day, but he has grown increasingly irritable with the sight and his conscience swells with the thought that he lacks the courage to express his disapproval. He had vowed to do so, but Holmes' cool, nonchalant manner made him the only man who would care to do anything approaching a liberty. Watson asks Holmes if he would like to try morphine or cocaine.

He heard all about the treasure and waited for it to be found. One day, he came upon the treasure. He learned about the trap door in the roof and about the supper hour. He brought the man out with a rope wound around his waist. The man climbed through the roof but was unable to get to the top. He found that Bartholomew Shola was still inside the room. He was surprised when he saw that the man was proud and that he was cursing him for a \"little blood-thirty imp.\" The narrator took the treasure box and slid it down to show that all the jewels were back.\n",
